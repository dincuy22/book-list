    <h2 id="leanpub-auto-conclusion-17">Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Congratulations on finishing <em>Django for Beginners</em>! After starting from absolute zero we’ve now built five different web applications from scratch and covered all the major features of Django: templates, views, urls, users, models, security, testing, and deployment. You now have the knowledge to go off and build your own modern websites with Django.</p>

    <p>As with any new skill, it’s important to practice and apply what you’ve just learned. The CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) functionality in our <em>Blog</em> and <em>Newspaper</em> sites is common in many, many other web applications. For example, can you make a Todo List web application? A Twitter or Facebook clone? You already have all the tools you need. When you’re starting out I believe the best approach is to build as many small projects as possible and incrementally add complexity and research new things.</p>

    <h3 id="leanpub-auto-next-steps">Next Steps</h3>

    <p>We explored a lot of Django material in this book but there is still much more to learn. This is especially true if you want to build large websites that must handle thousands or millions of visitors at a time. Django itself is more than capable of this. I’ve written a follow-up book called <a href="https://djangoforprofessionals.com">Django for Professionals</a> that tackles many of the challenges around building truly <em>production-ready</em> websites such as using Docker, a production database locally like PostgreSQL, advanced user registration, security, performance, and much more.</p>

    <p>Django is also frequently used to create back-end APIs consumable by either mobile apps (iOS/Android) or websites that use a dedicated JavaScript front-end framework such as Vue, React, or Angular. Thanks to the power of <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org">Django REST Framework</a>, a third-party app that is tightly coupled with Django itself, it is possible to transform any existing Django website into an API with a minimal amount of code. If you’d like to learn more, I’ve written an entire book on the topic called <a href="https://djangoforapis.com">Django for APIs</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="leanpub-auto-rd-party-packages">3rd Party Packages</h3>

    <p>As we’ve seen in this book, 3rd party packages are a vital part of the Django ecosystem especially when it comes to deployment or improvements around user registration. It’s not uncommon for a professional Django website to rely on literally dozens of such packages.</p>

    <p>However, a word of caution is in order: don’t blindly install and use 3rd party packages just because it saves a small amount of time now. Every additional package introduces another dependency, another risk that its maintainer won’t fix every bug or won’t keep up to date with the latest version of Django. Take the time to understand what it is doing.</p>

    <p>If you’d like to view more packages, the <a href="https://djangopackages.org/">Django Packages</a> website is a comprehensive resource of all available third party apps. For a more curated list of packages the <a href="https://github.com/wsvincent/awesome-django">awesome-django</a> repo is worth a look.</p>

    <h3 id="leanpub-auto-learning-resources">Learning Resources</h3>

    <p>As you become more comfortable with Django and web development in general, you’ll find the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">official Django documentation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/django/django">source code</a> increasingly valuable. I refer to both on an almost daily basis. There is also the <a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/">official Django forum</a>, a great resource albeit underutilized resource for Django-specific questions.</p>

    <p>You might also look at the <a href="https://github.com/wsvincent/djangox">DjangoX</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wsvincent/drfx">DRFX</a> starter projects to speed up the development of new projects.</p>

    <p>If you’re interested in a podcast on Django, I co-host <a href="https://djangochat.com">Django Chat</a>, which features interviews with leading developers and topic deep-dives. And I co-write a weekly newsletter, <a href="https://django-news.com">Django News</a>, filled with news, articles, tutorials, and more all about Django.</p>

    <h3 id="leanpub-auto-python-books">Python Books</h3>

    <p>Django is, ultimately, just Python so if your Python skills could use improvement there are two books in particular I recommend. For beginners and those new to Python, it doesn’t get much better than Eric Matthes’s <a href="http://amzn.to/2okggMH">Python Crash Course</a>. For intermediate to advanced developers, <a href="http://amzn.to/2ovfgsR">Fluent Python</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/2nCqivT">Effective Python</a> are worthy of additional study.</p>

    <h3 id="leanpub-auto-feedback">Feedback</h3>

    <p>If you purchased this book on Amazon, please consider leaving an honest review. For whatever reason, technical readers are often hesitant to write a review yet they make make an enormous impact on book sales and help me continue to teach Django.</p>

    <p>As a final note, I’d love to hear your thoughts about the book. It is a constant work-in-progress and the detailed feedback I receive from readers helps me continue to improve it. I try to respond to every email and can be reached at <code>will@wsvincent.com</code>.</p>

    <p>Thank you for reading the book and good luck on your journey with Django!</p>
