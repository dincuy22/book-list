    <h2 id="leanpub-auto-conclusion-19">Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Building a “professional” website is no small task even with all the help that a batteries-included web framework like Django provides. Docker provides a major advantage in standardizing both local and production environments regardless of local machine–and especially in a team context. However Docker is a complicated beast on its own. While we have used it judiciously in this book there is much more that it can do depending on the needs of a project.</p>

    <p>Django itself is friendly to small projects because its defaults emphasize rapid local development but these settings must be systematically updated for production, from upgrading the database to PostgreSQL, using a custom user model, environment variables, configuring user registration flow, static assets, email… on and on it goes.</p>

    <p>The good news is that the steps needed for a production-level approach are quite similar. Hence the first half of this book is deliberately agnostic about the eventual project that is built: you’ll find these steps are standard on almost any new Django project. The second half focused on building a real Bookstore site with modern best practices, added Reviews, image uploads, set permissions, added search, reviewed performance and security measures, and finally deployed on Heroku with containers.</p>

    <p>For all the content covered in this book we’ve really only scratched the surface of what Django can do. This is the nature of modern web development: constant iteration.</p>

    <p>Django is a magnificent partner in building out a professional website because so many of the considerations required have already been thought of and included. But knowledge is needed to know how to turn these production switches on to take full advantage of the customization Django allows. Ultimately that is the goal of this book: to expose you, the reader, to the full spectrum of what Django and professional websites require.</p>

    <p>As you learn more about web development and Django I’d urge caution when it comes to premature optimization. It is always tempting to add features and optimizations to your project that you <em>think</em> you’ll need later. The short list includes adding a CDN for static and media assets, judiciously analyzing database queries, adding indexes to models, and so on.</p>

    <p>The truth is that in any given web project there will always be more to do than time allows. This book has covered the fundamentals that are worthy of upfront time to get right. Additional steps around security, performance, and features will present themselves to you in real-time. Try to resist the urge to add complexity until absolutely necessary.</p>

    <h3 id="leanpub-auto-learning-resources">Learning Resources</h3>

    <p>As you become more comfortable with Django and web development in general, you’ll find the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">official Django documentation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/django/django">source code</a> increasingly valuable. I refer to both on an almost daily basis.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://forum.djangoproject.com/">official Django forum</a> is a great resource albeit underutilized resource for Django-specific questions. Many knowledgeable Django developers are on there and willing to help.</p>

    <p>If you like podcasts, I have co-hosted the <a href="https://djangochat.com">Django Chat</a> podcast alongside Django Fellow Carlton Gibson for the past three years. We release episodes every other week featuring prominent guests from the Django community. And I co-author a weekly newsletter, <a href="https://django-news.com">Django News</a>, filled with the latest news, articles, tutorials, and projects focused on Django.</p>

    <h3 id="leanpub-auto-feedback">Feedback</h3>

    <p>As a final note, I’d love to hear your thoughts about the book. It is a constant work-in-progress and the detailed feedback from readers helps me continue to improve it. I respond to every email and can be reached at <code>will@wsvincent.com</code>.</p>

    <p>If you purchased this book on Amazon, please consider leaving an honest review. These reviews make an enormous impact on book sales.</p>

    <p>Thank you for reading the book and good luck on your journey with Django!</p>
